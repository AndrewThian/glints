##Info

It's 10:18pm Sunday. I've completed the first portion of the required assignment. The code runs directly with jest presets.

> The only way to run the code is via `Jest` specs.

Reasons for doing so, I wanted to force myself to employ TDD practices instead of constantly logging to the commandline.

##how to run

My package.json scripts are as follows:

```
npm test - runs all the test cases
```
